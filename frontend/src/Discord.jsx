                <p>Located on the moon Irfan C in the Vaxal system, Hellions Tavern is owned and operated by the Dark Star Hellions swoop club and Nomads chapters. The famous and booming bar is home to not only Hellions, but Defilers of the Zann Consortium and other affiliates. It includes the Blackskulls Gambling Haven, which is a fully functioning casino ran by Hondo Walkerâ€™s Dosh clan, the Blackskulls. Neither Hellions, Zann, nor Hondo himself accept responsibility for any harm inflicted on patrons, especially those that choose to enter the fighting cage.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>
