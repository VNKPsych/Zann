            On Day 343, the following day after the Koros Spaceworks looting, Zann Consortium confirmed rumors that Defilers had successfully rendered eight planets uncontrolled in the sector of Churnis after the leader of the Mercenary Guild government failed to negotiate terms with Ximaro Jix.<br/><br/>
            At a public venue, Xakic Jix, Ximaro's younger brother, explained they had been working with and assisting the longtime friend and rogue Sith Lord Myn Kuat with his revenge on the government he created and once controlled.<br/><br/>
            During a series of attacks carried out by Ximaro and his covert operations members infiltrated, the Consortium aimed to demoralize the Mercenary Guild and ultimately collapse the government. After the attacks began, some members of Guild resigned from their positions within the government in an attempt to avoid any harm.<br/><br/>
            Shortly after the attacks began, it was clear that the Guild was not suitably prepared to repel a coordinated regime of chaos encroaching upon their worlds. In response, Pietre Hunimen, leader of the Mercenary Guild, urged the Galactic Empire for assistance on the advice of his second in command. Assessing the situation and realizing the continued threat to the rule of law that the Consortium posed to smaller and fringe governments, the Emperor agreed to send forces to aid the Guild. As their first step, the Galactic Empire notified Ximaro Jix that they would be providing military assistance to the Mercenary Guild throughout the Churnis sector and that continued acts of aggression by Zann personnel would result in the Empire considering them an enemy. Despite the warning, members of Zann Consortium and Dark Star Hellions were seen to be continuing attacks against the Guild's assets, stating that they would depart once their task was complete and when the Galactic Empire had received their message of bowing to none.
