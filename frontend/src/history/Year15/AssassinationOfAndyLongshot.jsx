            On Day 177, Andy "Vex" Longshot, Commodore of Pressure Pirates and Dark Star Hellions "Original Sergeant at Arms," was intercepted on a trading station in the orbit of planet Ord Vaxal in the Vaxal system. Andy walked into a trap that was created and set by Defiler Cell Leader Xanxus Drol and known Defiler and Pirate of Dread, Assurian Fury, who were both on the scene to ensure Andy would take the bait. Shortly after Vice President of Dark Star Hellions Seth Haze and Crime Lord of Zann Consortium Ximaro Jix arrived, Andy Longshot found himself barricaded on the trading station. Andy attempted to evade arrest but was quickly subdued and arrested by Haze. Shortly after, Assault Defiler Colton Hatfield entered into the trading station where Andy was held captive. Colton executed him swiftly and mercilessly despite Andy's pleas to Ximaro to see reason while Vice President Haze stood to watch over the prisoner.
