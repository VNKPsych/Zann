            On Day 275, after much deliberation, the Zann Consortium would become an official holding facility for syndicate hostages and prisoners. Individuals Higelourmi "Higgs" Evervir, Softim Elohim, Dyan Schnall, and Xavier Rayya were the first inmates brought through the doors by prison Defilers who guard the prison's hidden location.<br/><br/>
            Higelourmi Everivir, the former leader of Byblos Drive Yards, was elected to the position of Crew Leader within the prison and charged with the supervision of the other prisoners in their duties. When orders were made to eliminate Dyan Schnall due to alleged misbehavior and administrative decisions within the prison, the knife fell to Everivir. On Day 294, Higelourmi was observed by prison Defilers constraining Kubaz Dyan Schnall and escorting him to the cell block, executing him with an incision to the nape following a directive was given by 2nd Defiler Chazra Chak`na. The instruction was issued to either kill Dyan or be executed himself. Though reluctant, Higelourmi later articulated that decimating the prison population via the death sentence was mostly reasonable despite the corruption of the Consortium in light of the unruliness of the people. Everivir eventually went on to state he would execute again as ordered as he felt he ought to obey to preserve his life further. Such orders did ultimately follow as seen the case of Softim Elohim, a rebel agent captured for spying and placed in the prison by the Consortium.<br/><br/>
            Elohim was then notified that he was to be executed per Zann Consortium instruction. Softim, in his fear, apparently ate the cheap toxic paint already chipping off the new prison's walls, resulting in his death to avoid a potentially painful death from the death-dealing Arcona; instead, the chemical cocktail rendered the Alderanian partially comatose. This turn of events went on to further Higelourmi's reputation and humiliation among not just the Consortium, but the Dread pirates who initially captured him. As reports began to circulate through the galaxy of these events, soon numbers of bounty hunter groups reputedly offered to capture Everivir if the Consortium ever allowed the Arcona to be released.<br/><br/>
            In fear of his own potentially impending doom despite contrary reports from Everivir, the 2nd Lieutenant of the Galactic Empire Xavier Rayya followed Softim's footsteps choosing to take similar chemicals to eventually leaving himself entirely unaware and in a catatonic state of being identical to Elohim. Xavier expressed extreme paranoia to Black Sails staff explaining he would not end up like Dyan Schall, being killed by an Arcona that was now acting as the prison enforcer of an organization known for not letting sentients go free.<br/><br/>
            On Day 319, Eweff Gesorip was slain by Higlourmi, merely days after arriving into Black Sails Prison. Prison Defilers notified "Higgs" that Eweff identified himself as an agent of Imperial Intelligence through Sebastian Von Nex. With no evidence to prove such a claim other than alleged holo log recordings, Zann members allow Higlourmi to determine the young Kel Dor Gesorip's fate which Higlourmi quickly would, using his combat knife to a kill yet another harmless sentient, despite lack of credible information regarding Eweff's true allegiance.<br/><br/>
            Black Sails Prison can be found in the Vaxal system on the planet Caprol.
