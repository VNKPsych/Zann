            On Day 274, 2nd Lt. Rylla Sarat of the Galactic Empire revealed herself to be a Defiler of Zann Consortium. Immediately after, she went on to rob an armory aboard the Galactic Empire Lucrehulk Bastion. The robbery became highly disputed throughout the galaxy despite published holo-feeds of the loot taken. During the robbery, 3rd Defiler Sarat, who was assigned to the 1st Imperial Legion, 1st Brigade, also abducted Xavier Rayya who was already arrested. The robbery took place during an alleged terrorist alert in the system of Coruscant. Zann Consortium stated later that during the alarm, many Defilers kept a lookout in nearby systems for Imperial naval patrols. Among them, Ximaro Jix and Defilers Jesse Kilipso and Zane Apex were actively involved in loading up the Imperial weaponry and armor as well as securing the Imperial prisoner, who was presumably awaiting trial into custody, being escorted by Sarat at gunpoint.<br/><br/>
            A newscast detailing the event was hacked and broadcast by Greyson Abrams on the Galactic News System on Day 275.
