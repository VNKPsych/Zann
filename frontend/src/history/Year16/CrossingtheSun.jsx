            On Day 150, after disputes with Black Sun associate Eris Rosiir and Zann Consortium leader Ximaro Jix, Underlord Alexander von Ismay threatened Consortium leaders along with Ximaro Jix himself. Following the argument, Defilers from Zann Consortium accompanied by Dread pirates were then dispatched to inflict harm upon the illusive corporation. Shortly after the order was issued by Krestviniic Ximo Jobal, Defilers confirmed the slaying of Black Sun intelligence and military personnel.<br/><br/>
            On Day 153, Dread issued out a public statement reporting their role in the operation and the success of a combined attack against Black Sun.<br/><br/>
            On Day 159, Jeor Knight, Regent of Black Sun, confirmed the deaths of three Black Sun members publicly but does not verify their rank or positions. Jeor, in addition, issued a galactic bounty against Zann Consortium and its umbrella organizations for terrorist actions against their state. Jeor omitted the details of the amount to be paid open, despite previously stating the risk of further harm had been deemed low.
