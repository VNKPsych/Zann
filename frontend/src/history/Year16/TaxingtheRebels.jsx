            On Day 232, a Defiler inside of the government of the New Republic (NR), posing as an Army 2nd Lt., successfully raided one of the rebel armories. Numerous rebel trooper helmets and uniforms along with E-11b trooper rifles are among the equipment liberated from the supply depot. The Zann agent entered and left without a trace, evading security personnel and surveillance droids. Ximaro Jix later explained to NR officials that the operation was a little taxation on the rebellion for the rebels own attempts to undermine the terrorist network's activities around the galaxy.<br/><br/>
            On Day 240, a New Republic Intelligence agent by the name of Thrae Claddlyl attempted to lure Ximaro Jix into a trap to assassinate the Zann Consortium leader. He was subdued by a Zann Consortium security team and returned to the New Republic.<br/><br/>
            On Day 244, Kominiic Greyson Abrams of Zann Consortium released a GNS post highlighting the attempted assassination and the supply depot liberation.<br/><br/>
