            On Day 32, Alliance Special Operations (ASO) commander Xakic Jix suffered a loss as Qardin "Q" Fal-Cona, a rogue Hellion himself, would be kidnapped by Jarreth Darksky, a Zann Consortium Defiler, during a training exercise. The kidnapping and later murder of "Q" was a result of when he and other mutinous Hellions, including Seth Haze and Xakic Jix, failed to coup Zann Consortium which ultimately leads to the creation of the alleged rebel mercenary organization ASO. In addition to Zann's retaliation against rogue members, a Hellion named Robert Reynolds was taken captive during the uprising of the first conflict and was almost simultaneously freed by Juan Vargez who was accompanied by a small group of Dread pirates.<br/><br/>
            On Day 48, Zann Consortium sold Higelourmi Everivir into the slavery of a third party ending his many months in Black Sails Prison.<br/><br/>
            On Day 94, Jarreth Darksky brutally murders Alana Sinesael, wife to the late Qardin Fal-Cona, as a message to the Dark Star Hellions rogues that not even their families can evade future retribution from the Zann umbrella for their treachery.<br/><br/>
