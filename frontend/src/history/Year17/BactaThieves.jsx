            On Day 2, Athakam MedTech warehouses were raided by a small detachment of Defilers. The raid was conducted from behind Tion Hegemony borders through the use of a smuggler Brao Vinklo. No witnesses were able to observe the crime and no innocent civilians were harmed during the operation in which over one thousand healing supplies were stolen. Stolen items included bacta patches, bacta tanks, as well as refills and healing sticks.
