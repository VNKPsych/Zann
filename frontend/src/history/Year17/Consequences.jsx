            On Day 246, a business associate of Zann Consortium A`zol Surek, leader of Warrington and Surek Industries [WSI], was taken into custody after abusing his longtime relationship with the Consortium to undermine Zann legitimate business ventures and turn recruitment efforts of like-minded traders and associates against Zann for WSI benefit. A`zol was taken by Seth Haze without incident and was transported to Black Sails Prison with the understanding once he paid his debt to Zann, he would be released if he chose not to be executed. Lord Ximaro Jix stated in a closed transmission to the remainder of the fledgling organization, which Zann helped Surek engineer through a sizable amount of planetary assistance for production centers, that no harm would come to employees of the company; however A`zol would have to suffer the consequences of his actions and betrayal for secretly violating the confidential business relationship of Zann for his agenda.<br/><br/>
            On Day 247, just 24 hours after his capture and agreement to suffer the consequences for his mistakes, A`zol was found unconscious and unresponsive in his cell at Black Sails Prison. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding A`zol's sudden sickness remain unknown.            </text>
