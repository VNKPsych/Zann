                On Day 331, trader and information broker Looma Karwt were assassinated by Seth Haze of Cell 5 overseen by Zann Circle member Kyota Navic. Looma was captured immediately after Consortium agents rescued him from alleged kidnapper Fritjof Blom. Moments before he was killed, unbeknownst to Looma, the Defilers who were supposedly coming to his aid had been tracking Looma for some time for sharing Zann information with organization enemies.<br/><br/>
                The execution of Looma came just days after Death Watch leader Peter Max murdered Intelligence Officer Acelin Dominia of The Pentastar Alignment for his organization interfering with Zann affairs on separate occasions. The act became the first act of the Shadow Dominion alliance.
