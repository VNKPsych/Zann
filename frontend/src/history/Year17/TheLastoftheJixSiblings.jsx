            On Day 60, Chokk Ovin Jix, a half-blood, last of the brothers to Ximaro Jix, as well as a member of Dread pirates and Zann Consortium, was captured by Consortium agents. The event followed just months after Chokk's exile from Zann and later development of the Black Light Pirates which he utilized to make several attempts to undermine Zann influence and operations. The manhunt for Chokk proved a challenging task for Defilers given Chokk's previous history as a Cell leader in Zann and leader of the Defiler detachment within Dread. During his time in exile, Chokk and his compatriots waged a silent war against Ximaro and Zann, creating partnerships with various groups and working with individuals from the Galactic Alliance and Imperial Union to form a partnership to battle the terrorist network. Black Light Pirates were met with massive resistance from Defilers on all fronts, and ultimately Chokk was low on friends. With few allies remaining, Chokk decided it was best to seek alternative safer means to go about various businesses and contacted a reputable force sensitive for a force test. Unbeknownst to Chokk, the force user was part of Zann's large umbrella, and he was detained and later transported by Zann's Bounty Hunter cell to a location unknown.            </text>
