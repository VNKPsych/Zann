            On Day 10, Riipa Tinka of the Horizon Corporation, a small manufacturing group, was kidnapped by Overseer Kyota Navic. Moments before his capture, Riipa had been lured into a trap area by Kyota after requesting he be able to remove assets from Zann premises. Allowed to enter into a secure Zann storage facility, Riipa was placed under arrest by Navic who explained he was being kidnapped. Soon after that, an intense negotiation of freedom ensued, with Riipa which lasted a week. Eventually, Tinka was able to buy his freedom from his captor and was released paying close to 150 million in credits to Overseer Navic for his safe return. Navic later confirmed to various individuals of the galaxy that the kidnapping had been perpetrated by him alone and was not representative of anything Zann related and he was surprised the Horizon group would not do anything to assist their valued member.
