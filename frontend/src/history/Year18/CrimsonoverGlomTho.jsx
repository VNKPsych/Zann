            On Day 174, news broke of a successful Zann Consortium plot to loot Corporate Alliance (a member of the Rim Commonality). Correspondents identified that Koby Navarro of Matukai Dragons, a Krath Dynasty mercenary front, was influenced by second-in-command Shall Ti, a known Consortium associate, to murder the trading group head Elm Aran. Initially believed to be successful in preventing Shall from looting assets from the Alliance, Krath seized planetary assets in hopes to prevent Zann Consortium from taking control of the system; however, were later let down when the government of Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) intervened and later worked out an arrangement with Zann to retain ownership of two planetary holdings. The event would spark even more controversy as in the days to come CIS, along with Zann, would sign a joint defense contract for the protection of the system of Glom Tho.
