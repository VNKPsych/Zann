            On Day 132, the galaxy would observe the final breaths of the organization Edge-9 lead by the now dissolved Dark Star Hellions oldest traitor Xark Jephego. In the days before the closure of the organization, Defiler infiltrators released a volley of attacks inside of the anarchist group disrupting business and demoralizing its members. Despite resistance from Edge members and the size of the fledgling group, they were unable to recover from the anarchy released inside of their group which eventually led to several of their members turning against them demonstrating the ferocity of Zann Consortium. Unable to fend off against an unknown enemy in its last moments, Jephego started executing his members at random further weakening morale within his outfit, in hopes it would save his group. The combined actions of Xark and the corruption of Defilers within his organization brought closure to the company known as Edge-9.
