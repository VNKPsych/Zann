            On Day 197 of Year 19 the Hosnian system was revealed to the galactic public, sparking a conflict between multiple groups and governments, most notably the Galactic Empire and New Republic. Several Defilers were dispatched to the system to capitalize on the turmoil. The icy world of Courtsilius was swiftly captured by Zann Consortium, with Imperial General Fede Vonrico being taken hostage and subsequently executed. In an attempt to divert the Consortiumâ€™s attention, the Galactic Empire deployed another legion to the planet Loedorvia 2, which was occupied by Zann. In the failed Imperial assault, Navy Commodore Kyrvaal Vicus was slain by Defilers. Zann Consortium later sold Courtsilius for an undisclosed amount of credits to the New Republic.
