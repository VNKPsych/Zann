                In early year 23, Zann Defilers arranged for the silencing of Iskandar Valerian, an ex-associate of the Consortium. After flunking out of the organization’s elite Defiler training program and being permitted to exit Consortium space, the male H’nemthe began brokering secrets and info about the group indiscriminately to Tolondan rebels and random passers-by alike. As Zann prepared to act, retribution was immediate and unexpected when Iskander blundered directly into the clutches of Eidolan pirate Diabolus`ut Persolvo, who promptly took the foolish sentient captive.<br/><br/>
                Although held in custody for a short period, the Morgukai criminal ultimately released Iskander unscathed “more out of amusement than anything else.” Riding his wave of overconfidence to the crest after this show of mercy, the H’nemthe took only a few days to stumble from one capture to another; the latest trap having been orchestrated by Zann Defiler and Circle member Bork Shalas. Mercy was not shown a second time, and the sentence for breaching secrecy was death.
