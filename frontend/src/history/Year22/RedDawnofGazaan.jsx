            Late in Year 22 the Zann Consortium launched a ground invasion of the previously hidden planet Gazaan which was serving as a base of operations for Rebel Alliance forces in the sector. The initial assault caught the already ill-prepared rebels off guard, and the Alliance ordered a failed orbital bombardment to drive the terrorists and their allies from Gazaan’s surface. The Consortium’s second wave proved to be too overwhelming for the Rebel Alliance and they were forced to retreat, leaving Gazaan in the hands of the Zann umbrella. Despite being outnumbered from the start, it is estimated Zann Consortium lost only 700 mercenaries while the Rebel Alliance suffered over 3,000 casualties.
