            Circa Year 22 Day 100 the Zann Consortium deployed an assault fleet along with a Void Wolves attack squadron, to the peaceful system of Petabys with the objective of blockading the region to restrict commerce and trade. The Consortium’s presence was largely unchallenged until the Tresario Star Kingdom responded to the threat. The Kingdom’s efforts were met with catastrophe and defeat, as they are unable to overcome enemy resistance without reinforcements from their Imperial Union allies. The blockade persisted until the arrival of the entirety of the Rebel Alliance and its allies. Zann Consortium’s fleet held for the first few waves, however a retreat was made after swarms of A-wings were deployed.
