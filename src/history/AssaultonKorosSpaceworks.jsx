            On Day 342, nationalized subsidiary Koros Spaceworks of the Krath Dynasty government was looted by Namma Craken, niece to Tapar Craken. The estimated amount taken in credits and assets was estimated to be five billion in total. Also, rumors suggested as many as five hostages were taken. Krath Dynasty issued a five-hundred million credit bounty for Ximaro Jix for his repeated attacks on Krath Dynasty. Particularly, for assisting in what was regarded as engineering the plan, and what several Krath Officials including leader Lazarus Kell of the Krath Dynasty government proclaim was corrupting Namma Craken.<br/><br/>
            Lilitu Ningaz was also placed on the bounty list at four-hundred and fifty million credits.<br/><br/>
            Namma identified herself to be a member of the Zann Consortium covert operations group known as the Defilers. Namma's actions and statements earned her a four-hundred million credit bounty as well, later issued by Lazarus Kell who felt she was no longer corrupted merely.<br/><br/>
            It was speculated around Krath Dynasty for quite some time that Zann Consortium Defilers were planning an attack; however, it was Namma Craken who ultimately was the perpetrator. Lilitu Ningaz stated to Krath officials she was the one who had recruited Namma quite sometime earlier and put the plan in motion.<br/><br/>
            Despite the controversy and frequent denial by Krath regarding the looting and kidnappings, Krath Dynasty posted bounties on all members of Ximaro's former Dark Star Hellions founding members as well as all members of Zann Consortium.
