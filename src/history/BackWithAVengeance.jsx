            On Day 142, Zann Consortium engaged in warfare on the planet Vectinia in the Hewett sector. Following an address to the public, Ximaro Jix explained that Zann Consortium, along with allies The Death Watch and Dread, was engaged in conflict with the Trade Federation, Ailon Nova Guard and their alliance, the Galactic Concordiate. While these forces fought for control of the planet, Kohl Straffer and members of the Ailon Nova Guard looted billions of credits worth of assets which included twenty MC-60s, twenty MC-80As, and over four hundred T-65 X-wing Starfighters.<br/><br/>
            In the following weeks, Kohl Straffer would make his own organization known as the Nova Blades and join the Shadow Dominion alliance.<br/><br/>
            By the end of the conflict, the Shadow Dominion had succeeded in their war against the Galactic Concordiate. The battle forced them to retreat in spite of what many galactic officials stating that the Shadow Dominion was outgunned, outnumbered, and unable to stop the opposing forces from taking the planet. Various rumors spread throughout the HoloNet regarding the mass scale theft; however, nothing was ever confirmed on how much of the restricted technologies Zann Consortium had actually received. Casualties were also never confirmed regarding specific numbers, despite media footage showing Defilers along with their allies decimating builders across the planet in efforts to destroy morale and weaken their enemies infrastructure planetside.
