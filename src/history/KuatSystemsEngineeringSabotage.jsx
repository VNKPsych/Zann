            On Day 175, Vussek Kaos, an Operations Manager for Kuat Systems Engineering of the Galactic Empire's Ministry of Industry, revealed himself as a Zann Consortium infiltrator with the theft of thirty million credits and theft of over a thousand vehicles from the nationalized Imperial company. The theft resulted in the ownership transfer of ninety-five AT-ST's and over a thousand other vehicles, including two hundred S74-2 speeders; however, all of these remain secured within Imperial-owned facilities.<br/><br/>
            Ximaro Jix later stated that if the Galactic Empire sought to resume production within the affected factories where many of these vehicles remained, then they would more than likely have to remove the vehicles from the facilities and into open cities. If this was done, then this may eventually give Zann Defilers the opportunity to seize the assets if they could gain access to the shielded worlds. The Galactic Empire issued advisories that access to the planets would not be granted to anyone without authorization and reason to be planet-side and that any rumored disruption of factories was mere conjecture and wishful thinking in light of the planned expansion of current Kuat System Engineering production facilities.
