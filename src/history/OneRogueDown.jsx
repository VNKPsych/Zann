            On Day 47, news broke across the galaxy of the successful assassination of Commodore Jeff Knight of Rogue Squadron by Defilers lead by Seth Haze commander of Zann's 'Cell 5'. In the weeks prior the murder, rogue members were observed attacking Zann's manufacturing group, Black Hole Manufacturing. Despite repeated requests for diplomacy from the Consortium, the rebels continued to decline explaining that it was their right to attack Zann as its enemy. Zann Consortium's response engineered by then Circle member Kyota Navic was the removal of the rogueâ€™s senior commanding officer, leader of Saber Fleet, Jeff Knight. The Commodore was kidnapped, and executed as a message to the galaxy of Zann's continued lethality, and a statement of the rising new Krestvinic Navic that Zann would continue to deal with its enemies with extreme prejudice.            </text>
