        On Day 166, the galaxy would observe crime lord Ximaro Jix re-emerge, taking over The Octagon League with deadly force, alongside Defiler Cell Leader Zane Apex and several other cell members.<br/><br/>
        During the events that lead to this takeover, Leader Gamba Jaboli was captured by Ximaro personally and given the option to hand over The Octagon League to the criminal collective for which Zann Consortium resides over. Gamba made three requests during this makeover and offered Ximaro an alternative to killing him. However, the situation was unable to be resolved and Zane Apex ultimately executed Gamba Jaboli.<br/><br/>
        With The Octagon League now destroyed, Ximaro Jix vowed he would reboot the once known Galactic Alliance weapons supplier and New Republic PSA under a Zann banner, making the organization far more efficient then its founder had. Ximaro notified some of Gamba's employees that no harm would come to them except the initial attack which Xakic Jix, leader of the Dark Star Hellions, initially performed. This act involved killing Kraak Ak-Xaiva to convince the New Republic that it was Hellions in the open offensive and not Zann in the shadows.<br/><br/>
