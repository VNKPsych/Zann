            On Day 17, news spread across the galaxy that rebel government Triumvirate Coalition suffered an attack. Intelligence officials along with Coalition forces confirmed that former Consul and King of Triumvirate Rick Fias along with Zann second-in-command Greyson Abrams entered the government and looted bank vaults of credits over eleven billion credits. In addition to the credits stolen, Defilers commanded by Greyson changed over ownership paperwork of cities, ships, facilities, raw materials and weapons within Triumvirate territory. Finalizing the attack Greyson, along with Rick, went on to corrupt the local populace and convinced up to five thousand of the governmentâ€™s primary workforce along with troops to defect against their government. Zann leader Ximaro Jix was present in the territory assisting with the operation.<br/><br/>
            The operation happened just days after former Triumvirate Consul Dero Racto got into a heated argument with Ximaro over a neutral aggression pact Ximaro and Zann were trying to establish with Triumvirate to put an end to Zann's continued attacks against the Coalition. Details of the feud between the Consul and former Crime Lord were left unknown. During the looting, Fias announced he was a Defiler, which Ximaro later confirmed via multiple transmissions. Despite the large physical presence of Zann agents during the assault on the government, neither innocent civilians nor troops of Triumvirate were harmed. Rick went on to explain that any and all citizens found would be taken into custody by Defilers and would be given fair treatment. As Triumvirate Forces rushed to protect their holds, Zann cleared various ships of hostiles in the state's space and was observed present by hundreds of witnesses.<br/><br/>
            On Day 18, following a conversation between Ximaro and leader of Triumvirate Coalition Oli Noa, Ximaro transmitted to sources across the galaxy that more attacks against Triumvirate would continue in the future. A GNS article was posted by Kyota Navic detailing the Triumvirate Coalition raid.
